# Wordpress Search Blacklist
A useful function to filter out (404) some spamming and explicit keywords in the WordPress search feature.

## How to use

- Add the snippet PHP code at the end of **functions.php** in your WordPress theme.
- An updated blacklist is [here](https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist).

## Happy filtering ^_^

Feel free to fork and modify the code to customize the response redirect (I like to 404'em all ^_^).
